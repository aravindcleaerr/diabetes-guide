<h2><span class="icon-sm">🏪</span> Jan Aushadhi Stores (Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana)</h2>
<p>The Government of India operates over <strong>10,000+ Jan Aushadhi Kendras</strong> across the country that sell high-quality generic medicines at 50–90% less than branded equivalents. These stores are a lifeline for diabetes patients on a budget.</p>

<div class="info-cards">
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">💊</div>
<div class="ic-title">What's Available</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Metformin, glimepiride, glipizide, pioglitazone, voglibose, and many other oral diabetes medicines. Human insulin (regular and NPH) at approximately one-third the branded price. Basic blood pressure and cholesterol medications also available.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">📍</div>
<div class="ic-title">How to Find a Store</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Visit <strong>janaushadhi.gov.in</strong> or download the <strong>Jan Aushadhi Sugam</strong> app (available on Android and iOS) to locate the nearest store. You can also search for medicine availability and prices on the app. Stores are typically located near government hospitals and bus stands.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">📋</div>
<div class="ic-title">Requirements</div>
<div class="ic-text">A valid prescription from any registered doctor (government or private) is sufficient. No special card, registration, or income proof is needed. Anyone can purchase from these stores regardless of income level.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
<strong>Money-Saving Tip:</strong> Ask your doctor to write prescriptions using <strong>generic names</strong> (e.g., "Metformin 500mg" instead of brand names like "Glycomet" or "Glucophage"). By law, pharmacists must dispense the generic equivalent if the prescription uses the generic name. This alone can save 40–70% on monthly medicine costs.
</div>

<h2><span class="icon-sm">💉</span> Affordable Insulin: Biosimilars in India</h2>
<p>India is a global leader in biosimilar insulin production. Biosimilars are near-identical copies of branded insulins manufactured after the original patent expires. They undergo rigorous testing and are approved by the CDSCO (Indian FDA equivalent).</p>

<tr><th>Insulin Type</th><th>Branded (MNC)</th><th>Approx. MRP</th><th>Indian Biosimilar</th><th>Approx. MRP</th><th>Savings</th></tr>

<tr><td>Glargine (basal)</td><td>Lantus (Sanofi)</td><td>Rs 1,200–1,500/pen</td><td>Basalog (Biocon), Glaritus (Wockhardt)</td><td>Rs 450–650/pen</td><td>50–65%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Aspart (rapid)</td><td>NovoRapid (Novo Nordisk)</td><td>Rs 1,100–1,400/pen</td><td>Insugen-R (Biocon)</td><td>Rs 400–600/pen</td><td>50–60%</td></tr>

<div class="callout note">
<strong>Are Biosimilars Safe?</strong> Yes. Indian biosimilar insulins (Biocon, Wockhardt, Lupin) have been used by millions of patients for over a decade. Biocon's insulin products are also approved and sold in the US, EU, and Japan — meeting the strictest global regulatory standards. Switching from a branded insulin to its biosimilar is generally safe, but should be done under your doctor's supervision with blood sugar monitoring.
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
<strong>Money-Saving Tip:</strong> If your doctor prescribes a branded insulin pen, ask: "Is there a biosimilar equivalent available?" Many doctors prescribe branded out of habit or familiarity. A single switch from Lantus to Basalog can save Rs 6,000–10,000 per year.

<h2><span class="icon-sm">📊</span> Affordable Glucometers &amp; Test Strips</h2>
<p>Test strips are the biggest ongoing expense for blood glucose monitoring — often costing more than the glucometer itself.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Category</th><th>Glucometer Cost</th><th>Strip Cost (per strip)</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Budget</strong></td><td>Rs 400–800</td><td>Rs 8–15</td><td>Accu-Chek Active, Dr. Morepen BG-03, Control D</td></tr>

<tr><td><strong>Premium</strong></td><td>Rs 1,500–3,500</td><td>Rs 25–40</td><td>FreeStyle Libre Reader (CGM — strips not needed), Accu-Chek Guide</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<div class="callout tip">
<strong>Money-Saving Tips for Monitoring:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buy strips in bulk:</strong> Packs of 100 strips are significantly cheaper per strip than packs of 25 or 50</li>
<li><strong>Check online pharmacies:</strong> 1mg, PharmEasy, Netmeds, and Apollo Pharmacy often offer 15–25% discounts on strips</li>
<li><strong>Government hospital labs:</strong> Many offer fasting and post-meal glucose tests for Rs 20–50 each</li>
<li><strong>Choose a glucometer based on strip cost, not meter cost:</strong> A "free" glucometer with expensive strips costs more in the long run than a paid meter with cheap strips</li>
<li><strong>HbA1c test:</strong> Available for Rs 200–400 at most labs (Thyrocare, SRL, Dr. Lal PathLabs offer packages). Government hospitals often do it for Rs 50–100</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2><span class="icon-sm">🏕️</span> Free Diabetes Screening &amp; Care Camps</h2>
