<h2><span class="icon-sm">💧</span> Why Hydration Matters in Diabetes</h2>
<p>Water is not just important for diabetes — it is essential for managing it. Here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dehydration raises blood sugar:</strong> Less water in the bloodstream means glucose becomes more concentrated. Even mild dehydration (1–2% body weight loss) can raise blood sugar by 50–100 mg/dL.</li>
<li><strong>Kidneys need water:</strong> The kidneys flush excess glucose through urine. Without adequate water, this process is impaired, and glucose stays in the blood longer.</li>
<li><strong>SGLT2 inhibitors increase dehydration risk:</strong> These medications cause extra glucose and water loss through urine. Without compensatory fluid intake, dehydration, dizziness, and low blood pressure can occur.</li>
<li><strong>Prevents UTIs:</strong> Adequate hydration dilutes urine and flushes bacteria — critical since diabetics are 2–3x more prone to urinary infections.</li>
<li><strong>Supports kidney function:</strong> Diabetic kidneys are already under stress. Chronic dehydration accelerates diabetic nephropathy progression.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Much Water?</h3>
<div class="callout note">
<strong>Daily Water Intake Guidelines:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>General:</strong> 8–10 glasses (2–2.5 liters) per day</li>
<li><strong>Summer / hot climate:</strong> 10–12 glasses (2.5–3 liters)</li>
<li><strong>During exercise:</strong> Add 1–2 glasses per 30 minutes of activity</li>
<li><strong>On SGLT2 inhibitors:</strong> Add 2–3 extra glasses above baseline</li>
<li><strong>With kidney disease (CKD):</strong> Fluid may be restricted — follow your nephrologist's advice</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simple hydration check:</strong> Your urine should be pale yellow. Dark yellow urine means you need more water. Clear/colorless may indicate overhydration.</p>

<div class="info-cards">
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">💧</div>
<div class="ic-title">Plain Water</div>
<div class="ic-text">The gold standard. Zero calories, zero carbs, zero sugar. Room temperature or cool — both are fine. Add a squeeze of lemon or a few mint leaves for flavor without sugar. Sparkling/soda water is also fine (check label for zero sugar).</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🥛</div>
<div class="ic-title">Buttermilk / Chaas</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Excellent Indian beverage for diabetics. Made from diluted curd/yogurt. Provides probiotics, protein, and electrolytes. Very low carb content (~5g per glass).</p>
<p><strong>Best preparation:</strong> Blend curd with water (1:3 ratio), add cumin powder, salt, and chopped coriander. Avoid adding sugar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🍵</div>
<div class="ic-title">Green Tea</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Rich in catechins (antioxidants) that may improve insulin sensitivity. Studies suggest 3–4 cups daily may reduce fasting blood sugar by 5–10 mg/dL over time. Also supports heart health and weight management.</p>
<p><strong>Drink without sugar.</strong> Honey is NOT a healthy substitute — it raises blood sugar just like sugar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">☕</div>
<div class="ic-title">Black Coffee (Moderate)</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Black coffee (without sugar, cream, or flavored syrups) has near-zero calories and may improve insulin sensitivity long-term. Limit to 2–3 cups per day. Caffeine can cause short-term blood sugar spikes in some people — monitor your response.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Frappuccinos, flavored lattes, coffee with sugar — these are desserts, not beverages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🍋</div>
<div class="ic-title">Nimbu Pani (Without Sugar)</div>
<div class="ic-text">Fresh lime/lemon water with a pinch of salt and black salt (kala namak). Refreshing, hydrating, virtually zero carbs. Add a pinch of roasted cumin powder for digestive benefit. Use stevia if you need sweetness — never add sugar or honey.</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🌿</div>
<div class="ic-title">Herbal Teas</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Chamomile tea (may help with sleep and blood sugar), cinnamon tea (may improve insulin sensitivity), ginger tea (aids digestion, anti-inflammatory), tulsi (holy basil) tea, hibiscus tea.</p>
<p>All are zero-calorie when consumed without sugar. Fenugreek (methi) seed water — soak methi seeds overnight, strain, drink in the morning — traditional remedy with some evidence for glucose lowering.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-cards">
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🥥</div>
<div class="ic-title">Coconut Water</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Natural electrolyte drink, but <strong>not sugar-free</strong>. One small (200 mL) serving contains approximately 10–12g of natural sugar. Glycemic index is moderate (~55).</p>
<p><strong>Limit:</strong> 1 small cup (200 mL) per day. Best consumed after exercise when the body can use the sugar. Avoid packaged/flavored coconut water — often has added sugar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🥤</div>
<div class="ic-title">Diet Sodas / Zero-Sugar Drinks</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Contain artificial sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame-K) with zero or near-zero calories and no direct blood sugar impact. Technically safe for blood sugar, but concerns exist about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Altering gut microbiome (some studies suggest this may worsen insulin resistance over time)</li>
<li>Maintaining sweet cravings, making dietary adherence harder</li>
<li>Phosphoric acid in colas affects bone health</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Acceptable occasionally, but water and herbal teas are better long-term choices. Limit to 1 per day maximum.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🥛</div>
<div class="ic-title">Milk</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>One glass (200 mL) of whole milk contains ~10g of natural lactose (milk sugar). Good source of calcium and protein, but must be counted in your carb budget.</p>
<p><strong>Best choice:</strong> Low-fat or toned milk. Limit to 1–2 glasses per day. Avoid flavored milk (chocolate, strawberry, badam) — loaded with added sugar. If lactose intolerant, unsweetened almond or soy milk are good alternatives.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🫗</div>
<div class="ic-title">Vegetable Juices (Fresh)</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Fresh-pressed vegetable juices (karela/bitter gourd, lauki/bottle gourd, cucumber, spinach, celery) have minimal sugar and some evidence for blood sugar benefit. However, juicing removes fiber.</p>
<p><strong>Better option:</strong> Eat whole vegetables instead. If juicing, avoid adding fruit (especially apple or beet) to sweeten.</p>

<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🧃</div>
<div class="ic-title">Fruit Juices</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p><strong>Even "100% natural, no added sugar" fruit juice is dangerous for diabetics.</strong> A glass of orange juice contains 25–30g of fast-absorbing sugar without the fiber of the whole fruit. Blood sugar spikes within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Packaged juices (Real, Tropicana, B Natural) are even worse — most contain added sugar despite marketing claims. A 200 mL tetrapack can contain 20–30g sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Eat the fruit, don't drink it. One whole orange has fiber that slows absorption; a glass of OJ from 3–4 oranges delivers a sugar bomb.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🥤</div>
<div class="ic-title">Sugary Sodas &amp; Cold Drinks</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>A 330 mL can of Coca-Cola, Pepsi, or Thums Up contains <strong>35–39g of sugar</strong> (almost 10 teaspoons). This is one of the worst possible beverages for a diabetic.</p>
<p>Regular consumption of sugary sodas is independently associated with a 26% increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes even in non-diabetics.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">⚡</div>
<div class="ic-title">Energy Drinks</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Red Bull, Monster, Sting, and similar drinks contain 27–55g of sugar per can PLUS high caffeine (80–160 mg). The combination of sugar and caffeine causes dramatic blood sugar spikes and cardiovascular stress.</p>
<p>Even "sugar-free" energy drinks deliver excessive caffeine that can cause palpitations, anxiety, and blood pressure spikes — dangerous in diabetics with existing heart disease.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🥤</div>
<div class="ic-title">Sweetened Lassi / Mango Shake / Badam Milk</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Traditional sweetened lassi can contain 30–40g of sugar per glass. Mango shake (mango + milk + sugar) is an extreme sugar load. Packaged badam milk contains 15–20g of added sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Plain salted lassi or chaas (buttermilk) is fine. If you want a mango treat, eat half a small mango as part of a meal (with protein and fat to slow absorption).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="info-card">
<div class="ic-icon">🧊</div>
<div class="ic-title">Packaged Iced Tea &amp; Flavored Water</div>
<div class="ic-text">
<p>Nestea, Lipton Ice Tea, and similar packaged iced teas contain 20–25g of sugar per bottle — marketed as "healthy" but essentially sugar water with tea flavoring. Flavored/vitamin-enhanced waters (Glaceau, etc.) also often contain hidden sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Make your own:</strong> Brew tea, chill it, add lemon and stevia. Costs less and has zero sugar.</p>

<h2><span class="icon-sm">☕</span> Filter Coffee &amp; Chai Guidance</h2>
<p>Tea and coffee are cultural staples in India. Here is how to enjoy them wisely:</p>

<div class="callout tip">
<strong>Coffee (Filter Coffee / Instant Coffee):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Limit to <strong>2–3 cups per day</strong></li>
<li>Use <strong>no sugar</strong> or a sugar substitute (stevia, sucralose)</li>
<li>Use <strong>low-fat milk</strong> in small amounts, or switch to black coffee</li>
<li>Traditional South Indian filter coffee with decoction is fine if you skip the sugar — the chicory in filter coffee may actually have mild blood sugar benefits</li>
<li>Avoid: Coffee from vending machines (pre-mixed with sugar and creamer), cold coffee from cafes (loaded with sugar and cream)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
<strong>Tea (Chai):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Limit to <strong>2–3 cups per day</strong></li>
<li>Gradually reduce sugar: go from 2 spoons → 1 spoon → half spoon → zero over 2–4 weeks. Your taste buds will adapt.</li>
<li>Use low-fat milk or make "kadak" chai with spices (elaichi, adrak, dalchini) — spices add flavor that masks the absence of sugar</li>
<li>Masala chai with ginger and cinnamon may actually have mild glucose-lowering effects</li>
<li>Avoid: Cutting chai from roadside stalls (made with excessive sugar), packaged premix chai sachets</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2><span class="icon-sm">🍺</span> Alcohol and Diabetes</h2>
<p>Alcohol has complex, potentially dangerous interactions with diabetes. If you drink, you must understand the risks:</p>

<h3>Key Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):</strong> The liver normally releases stored glucose to prevent low blood sugar. Alcohol blocks this process for up to 12–24 hours. This means severe hypoglycemia can occur hours after drinking — even the next morning.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed hypoglycemia:</strong> You may go to bed with normal blood sugar after drinking, then develop dangerous hypoglycemia at 2–3 AM when the liver is still processing alcohol.</li>
<li><strong>Masked symptoms:</strong> Alcohol intoxication symptoms (confusion, unsteadiness, slurred speech) mimic hypoglycemia. Others around you may think you are "just drunk" and not recognize a medical emergency.</li>
<li><strong>Calorie load:</strong> Alcohol has 7 calories per gram (almost as much as fat). Beer and sweet wines contain significant carbohydrates that cause initial blood sugar spikes followed by delayed drops.</li>
<li><strong>Medication interactions:</strong> Metformin + heavy alcohol increases lactic acidosis risk. Sulfonylureas + alcohol increases hypoglycemia risk. Alcohol can also cause facial flushing with some diabetes drugs.</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout warning">
<strong>Safe Alcohol Limits (If You Choose to Drink):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower limit (generally recommended for smaller body size):</strong> Maximum 1 standard drink per day</li>
<li><strong>Upper limit (generally recommended for larger body size):</strong> Maximum 2 standard drinks per day</li>
<li><strong>1 standard drink =</strong> 350 mL beer (5% ABV) = 150 mL wine = 45 mL spirits (whiskey, vodka, rum)</li>
<li><strong>NEVER drink on an empty stomach</strong> — always eat a carb-containing meal with alcohol</li>
<li><strong>Check blood sugar before bed</strong> after drinking — eat a snack if below 120 mg/dL</li>
<li><strong>Set an alarm</strong> to check blood sugar at 2–3 AM after an evening of drinking</li>
<li><strong>Wear a medical ID</strong> — so others know you have diabetes if you become confused</li>
<li><strong>Avoid sweet mixers:</strong> Use soda water, lime, or diet tonic water instead of regular tonic, cola, or fruit juice</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="callout danger">
<strong>When to NEVER Drink Alcohol:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you have a history of severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia unawareness</li>
<li>If you have diabetic neuropathy (alcohol worsens nerve damage)</li>
<li>If you have liver disease or pancreatitis</li>
<li>If you are pregnant or trying to conceive</li>
<li>If you take metformin and have kidney impairment (lactic acidosis risk)</li>
<li>During fasting periods (no food to buffer the hypoglycemic effect)</li>
</ul>
