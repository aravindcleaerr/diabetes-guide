<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F4AA;</span> Real Patient Success Stories</h2>

<h3>A Journey to Type 2 Remission</h3>
<p>One individual was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in their late 30s with an HbA1c of 9.2%. The doctor started them on metformin and glimepiride, but they also committed to walking 45 minutes daily, switching to millet-based rotis, reducing rice portions by half, and eliminating sugary chai. Within 18 months, their HbA1c dropped to 5.8%, and the doctor was able to stop glimepiride entirely. They continue on metformin and maintain their lifestyle changes. "The diagnosis was a wake-up call. I am healthier now than I was years ago."</p>

<h3>Living Well with LADA</h3>
<p>Another individual was diagnosed with LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults) at age 40, initially treated as Type 2 before antibody tests confirmed autoimmune diabetes. After switching to insulin therapy and starting a CGM, their Time in Range improved from 45% to 78%. They run a small business, play badminton three times a week, and mentor newly diagnosed adults in an online support group. "Insulin gave me my life back. I wish I had started it sooner."</p>

<h3>Type 1 Since Childhood</h3>
<p>Diagnosed at age 8, one person grew up managing Type 1 diabetes through school, college, and now a career in graphic design. They use an insulin pump and CGM, and track carbs meticulously. They completed a half-marathon in 2024 and blog about living with Type 1 in India. "Diabetes is part of my story, not the whole story."</p>

<h3>Reversing Complications</h3>
<p>One person was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at 45 and largely ignored it for a decade. By age 55, they had early nephropathy (UACR 180 mg/g) and mild retinopathy. A stern conversation with a new endocrinologist was the turning point. They started insulin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, controlled blood pressure aggressively, and lost 12 kg. Five years later, their UACR improved to 45 mg/g and retinopathy stabilised. "I regret the years I wasted, but I am grateful it is not too late."</p>
