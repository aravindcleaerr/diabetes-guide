<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F4AC;</span> Disclosure Decisions</h2>
<p>Whether to tell your employer or colleagues about your diabetes is a personal decision. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reasons to disclose</strong>: safety (colleagues can help during hypoglycemia), ability to request accommodations, less stress from hiding self-care activities, legal protections may require disclosure</li>
<li><strong>Reasons for caution</strong>: potential stigma, privacy concerns, worry about career impact</li>
<li><strong>Who to tell</strong>: at minimum, inform your immediate supervisor and one trusted colleague who can recognize and assist with hypoglycemia</li>
<li>You are not legally obligated to disclose during interviews or hiring in most jurisdictions</li>
<li>If you do disclose, keep it factual and brief — "I have diabetes, it is well-managed, and I may occasionally need to check my blood sugar or eat a snack"</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">In India, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (2016) and in many other countries, disability discrimination laws protect people with diabetes from workplace discrimination. Know your local laws.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F4C9;</span> Managing Blood Sugar at Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep your glucose meter (or rely on your CGM) easily accessible at your desk or workstation</li>
<li>Set phone alarms for testing and medication times</li>
<li>If blood sugar is high after lunch, a brief 10–15 minute walk can help bring it down</li>
<li>Stay hydrated — keep a water bottle at your desk</li>
<li>Learn how work-related stress affects your blood sugar and plan accordingly</li>
<li>If using insulin, identify a private space for injections if needed (though most people inject discreetly at their desk)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F371;</span> Snack and Meal Planning</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pack your lunch</strong> — this gives you full control over ingredients and portions</li>
<li>Keep a "diabetes drawer" at work with emergency supplies:
<ul>
<li>Glucose tablets or juice boxes (for hypoglycemia)</li>
<li>Healthy snacks: nuts, roasted chana, peanut butter, whole-grain crackers</li>
<li>A spare glucose meter and strips</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If eating in the cafeteria, choose grilled over fried, extra vegetables, controlled portions of rice/bread</li>
<li>Avoid skipping meals due to meetings — eat on schedule or have a snack beforehand</li>
<li>For office celebrations (birthday cake, festival sweets), take a small portion or politely decline — have a prepared response ready</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">Meal-prepping on weekends saves time during the workweek and ensures you always have a diabetes-friendly lunch available.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F3CB;&#xFE0F;</span> Desk Exercises</h2>
<p>Prolonged sitting worsens insulin resistance. Incorporate movement every 30–60 minutes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seated leg raises</strong> — extend one leg, hold for 10 seconds, alternate; 10 reps each</li>
<li><strong>Chair squats</strong> — stand up from your chair and sit back down slowly; 10 reps</li>
<li><strong>Calf raises</strong> — stand behind your chair, rise on toes, hold, lower; 15 reps</li>
<li><strong>Desk push-ups</strong> — lean against the desk edge and do push-ups; 10 reps</li>
<li><strong>Walking meetings</strong> — suggest walking instead of sitting for one-on-one discussions</li>
<li><strong>Stair climbing</strong> — take stairs instead of the elevator</li>
<li><strong>Standing desk</strong> — alternate between sitting and standing if available</li>
<li>Set a timer to stand and stretch every 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F303;</span> Shift Work Challenges</h2>
<p>Shift work (especially rotating and night shifts) significantly disrupts diabetes management:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Circadian disruption</strong> — insulin sensitivity varies throughout the day; night shift workers often have higher insulin resistance</li>
<li><strong>Meal timing</strong> — irregular eating patterns make blood sugar unpredictable</li>
<li><strong>Sleep deprivation</strong> — worsens insulin resistance and increases appetite</li>
<li><strong>Medication timing</strong> — when to take once-daily medications becomes complicated</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips for Shift Workers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Work with your doctor to create a medication schedule tailored to your shift pattern</li>
<li>Eat regular, balanced meals even during night shifts — avoid relying on vending machines</li>
<li>Pack healthy meals and snacks for every shift</li>
<li>Monitor blood sugar more frequently during shift transitions</li>
<li>Prioritize sleep — use blackout curtains, earplugs, and maintain a consistent sleep routine</li>
<li>If on insulin, basal-bolus regimens are more flexible than fixed-dose regimens for shift workers</li>
</ul>
<div class="warning">Rotating shifts are the most disruptive. If possible, request fixed shifts (even night shifts are easier to manage than rotating ones).</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x2696;&#xFE0F;</span> Legal Rights and Accommodations</h2>
<p>People with diabetes are entitled to reasonable workplace accommodations in most countries:</p>
<h3>Accommodations You Can Request</h3>
<ul>
<li>Permission to check blood sugar and take medications at your workstation</li>
<li>Scheduled breaks for meals and snacks (consistent timing)</li>
<li>Access to a private space for insulin injections if preferred</li>
<li>A place to store insulin (refrigerator access)</li>
<li>Permission to keep food and glucose tablets at your desk</li>
<li>Flexible scheduling for medical appointments</li>
<li>Modified shift patterns if rotating shifts are causing dangerous blood sugar instability</li>
<li>Rest breaks if experiencing hypoglycemia</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">Document your needs with a letter from your doctor and submit a formal accommodation request through HR. Keep copies of all correspondence.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F6A8;</span> Dealing with Emergencies at Work</h2>
<h3>Hypoglycemia</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep glucose tablets or juice at your desk and on your person at all times</li>
<li>Teach at least one colleague to recognize hypoglycemia symptoms (confusion, sweating, shaking, pale skin)</li>
<li>Show them where your glucose tablets and glucagon kit are stored</li>
<li>Wear a medical ID bracelet</li>
<li>If you feel low, treat immediately — do not try to finish a task first</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hyperglycemia / DKA</h3>
<ul>
<li>If blood sugar is persistently above 300 mg/dL with symptoms (nausea, rapid breathing, confusion), seek medical attention</li>
<li>Stay hydrated and take correction insulin if prescribed</li>
</ul>
<div class="warning">Create a simple one-page "emergency card" for your desk or locker with: your diagnosis, medications, emergency contact, doctor's number, and instructions for colleagues on what to do if you are found unresponsive.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F9D8;</span> Stress Management at the Workplace</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identify your stress triggers — deadlines, conflicts, workload, commute</li>
<li>Use brief relaxation techniques: 2-minute deep breathing between tasks</li>
<li>Take your full lunch break — step away from your desk</li>
<li>Set realistic boundaries on workload and overtime</li>
<li>Use the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) if available for counseling</li>
<li>Maintain social connections with supportive colleagues</li>
<li>Separate work and personal life — avoid checking emails outside work hours</li>
</ul>
