<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F517;</span> The Bidirectional Relationship</h2>
<p>Diabetes impairs immune function and increases inflammation, making the gums more susceptible to infection. In turn, periodontal (gum) disease creates a chronic inflammatory state that worsens insulin resistance and makes blood glucose harder to control.</p>
<ul>
<li>People with diabetes are 2-3 times more likely to develop periodontitis.</li>
<li>Severe periodontitis is associated with an increase in HbA1c of approximately 0.3-0.4%.</li>
<li>Treating periodontal disease has been shown to modestly improve HbA1c (by ~0.3-0.4%) in several studies.</li>
<li>Poor glycemic control accelerates gum disease progression, creating a vicious cycle.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">Think of periodontal treatment as part of your diabetes management plan. Healthy gums contribute to better blood glucose control, and good glucose control protects your gums.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1FA78;</span> Periodontitis (Gum Disease)</h2>
<p>Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that destroys the supporting structures of the teeth — the gums, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone. It is the sixth most common complication of diabetes.</p>
<h3>Stages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gingivitis:</strong> The earliest stage — red, swollen gums that bleed easily during brushing or flossing. Reversible with good oral hygiene and professional cleaning.</li>
<li><strong>Early periodontitis:</strong> Inflammation extends deeper; early bone loss begins. Pockets form between teeth and gums (4-5 mm).</li>
<li><strong>Moderate periodontitis:</strong> Significant bone loss; deeper pockets (5-7 mm); teeth may begin to loosen.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced periodontitis:</strong> Severe bone destruction; deep pockets (&gt;7 mm); tooth mobility and migration; tooth loss.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Symptoms to Watch For</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gums that bleed during brushing, flossing, or eating.</li>
<li>Red, swollen, or tender gums.</li>
<li>Gums that have pulled away from the teeth (recession).</li>
<li>Persistent bad breath (halitosis) or bad taste in the mouth.</li>
<li>Loose teeth or teeth that have shifted position.</li>
<li>Changes in bite alignment or denture fit.</li>
<li>Pus between teeth and gums.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F4A7;</span> Dry Mouth (Xerostomia)</h2>
<p>Reduced saliva production is common in diabetes, caused by hyperglycemia, dehydration, autonomic neuropathy, and several diabetes medications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Saliva is essential for neutralizing acids, washing away food particles, and controlling bacterial growth.</li>
<li>Dry mouth increases the risk of dental cavities, gum disease, and oral infections.</li>
<li>Symptoms: persistent dryness, difficulty swallowing or speaking, cracked lips, burning sensation, altered taste.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stay well hydrated — sip water throughout the day.</li>
<li>Chew sugar-free gum or suck sugar-free candy to stimulate saliva production.</li>
<li>Use alcohol-free mouthwash (alcohol worsens dryness).</li>
<li>Consider saliva substitutes or artificial saliva products (gels, sprays).</li>
<li>Use a humidifier at night.</li>
<li>Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco, which all worsen dry mouth.</li>
<li>If severe, discuss with your doctor — medications like pilocarpine may help.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F9AB;</span> Oral Candidiasis (Thrush)</h2>
<p>A fungal infection caused by Candida species, which thrives in the high-glucose, low-saliva environment of the diabetic mouth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Appears as white, creamy patches on the tongue, inner cheeks, or palate that can be wiped off, leaving red or bleeding tissue underneath.</li>
<li>Can also present as redness and soreness without white patches (erythematous candidiasis).</li>
<li>Angular cheilitis (cracking at the corners of the mouth) is often related to Candida.</li>
<li>More common with poor glycemic control, denture use, dry mouth, antibiotic use, or inhaled corticosteroids.</li>
<li>Treatment: topical antifungals (nystatin suspension, clotrimazole troches) or systemic fluconazole for severe/recurrent cases.</li>
<li>Prevention: good glucose control, proper denture hygiene, and treating dry mouth.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F441;</span> Other Oral Manifestations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burning mouth syndrome:</strong> A burning sensation in the tongue or oral mucosa, possibly related to neuropathy or dry mouth.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed wound healing:</strong> Oral surgical wounds (extractions, biopsies) heal more slowly in poorly controlled diabetes.</li>
<li><strong>Increased cavity risk:</strong> High salivary glucose feeds bacteria; reduced saliva decreases natural protection.</li>
<li><strong>Lichen planus:</strong> Slightly more prevalent in diabetes; presents as white, lacy patches or painful erosions.</li>
<li><strong>Taste disturbances:</strong> Altered taste perception (dysgeusia) may occur with neuropathy or dry mouth.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>Daily Home Care</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brush teeth at least twice daily with a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste.</li>
<li>Replace your toothbrush every 3 months or when bristles become frayed.</li>
<li>Floss at least once daily — cleans the 35% of tooth surfaces that brushing misses.</li>
<li>Consider an electric toothbrush — studies show they are more effective at plaque removal.</li>
<li>Use an antimicrobial or fluoride mouthwash (alcohol-free if you have dry mouth).</li>
<li>Clean dentures daily if applicable; remove them at night.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Professional Care</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dental cleanings every 6 months</strong> (or more frequently if periodontitis is present — every 3-4 months).</li>
<li>Comprehensive periodontal examination at least annually.</li>
<li>Full-mouth X-rays every 1-2 years to assess bone levels.</li>
<li>Deep cleaning (scaling and root planing) if pockets are present.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F4CB;</span> Inform Your Dentist About Your Diabetes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tell your dentist that you have diabetes, your current HbA1c, and all medications you take.</li>
<li>Bring a list of your medications to every dental appointment (especially anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and bisphosphonates).</li>
<li>Schedule dental procedures in the morning when blood glucose tends to be most stable.</li>
<li>Eat normally and take your diabetes medications before the appointment (do not skip meals).</li>
<li>Bring glucose tablets or a snack in case of hypoglycemia during or after the procedure.</li>
<li>Inform your dentist if your blood glucose has been poorly controlled recently — elective procedures may need to be postponed.</li>
<li>Antibiotics may be needed before or after invasive procedures if glucose control is poor or if you have heart valve disease.</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">Good communication between your diabetes care team and your dentist improves outcomes for both conditions. Ask your dentist to send updates to your primary physician or endocrinologist.</div>
