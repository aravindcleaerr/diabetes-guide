<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#9878;</span> BMI Targets</h2>
<p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple weight-to-height ratio: BMI = weight (kg) &divide; height (m)&sup2;</p>

<div class="note">Asian Indians develop insulin resistance and diabetes at lower BMI values than Western populations. The revised Asian criteria reflect this increased metabolic risk at lower body weights.</div>

<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#128207;</span> Waist Circumference &mdash; A Better Indicator</h2>
<p>Abdominal (visceral) fat is more metabolically harmful than overall body fat. Waist circumference is a practical proxy for visceral fat.</p>

<p><strong>How to measure:</strong> Stand upright, find the midpoint between the lowest rib and the top of the hip bone. Wrap a measuring tape around the waist at this level, keeping it snug but not compressing the skin. Measure at the end of a normal exhalation.</p>
<div class="warning">A waist circumference &ge;90 cm (assigned male at birth) or &ge;80 cm (assigned female at birth) in Indian populations is an independent risk factor for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, regardless of BMI.</div>

<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#128293;</span> Caloric Deficit Basics</h2>
<p>Weight loss occurs when you consistently consume fewer calories than you burn. This is called a caloric deficit.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 kg of body fat &asymp; 7,700 calories.</strong></li>
<li>A deficit of <strong>500 calories/day</strong> leads to approximately <strong>0.5 kg (1 lb) weight loss per week</strong>.</li>
<li>A deficit of 500&ndash;750 calories/day is considered safe and sustainable.</li>
<li>Calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) using online calculators or a dietitian assessment, then subtract 500&ndash;750 to get your target intake.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where to Create the Deficit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diet alone:</strong> Easier to create a 500-calorie deficit by cutting food than by exercising it off. However, diet-only approaches risk muscle loss.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise alone:</strong> Difficult to sustain a large deficit through exercise alone (a 30-minute brisk walk burns only ~150 calories).</li>
<li><strong>Combination (recommended):</strong> Reduce intake by ~300 calories and increase activity to burn ~200 calories. Preserves muscle and is more sustainable.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#128200;</span> The Impact of Weight Loss on Diabetes</h2>
<p>Weight loss is one of the most powerful interventions for Type 2 diabetes. The benefits are dose-dependent:</p>
<div class="table-wrap">
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Weight Loss</th><th>Expected Benefits</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>5%</strong> of body weight</td><td>Improved insulin sensitivity; modest reduction in fasting glucose and HbA1c (0.2&ndash;0.3%)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>7&ndash;10%</strong></td><td>Significant improvement in HbA1c (0.5&ndash;1.0%); reduced blood pressure; improved lipid profile; potential reduction or elimination of some medications</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>10&ndash;15%</strong></td><td>Potential diabetes remission (HbA1c &lt;6.5% without glucose-lowering medications); substantially reduced cardiovascular risk</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>&gt;15%</strong> (often via surgery)</td><td>High rates of diabetes remission (up to 60&ndash;80%); major improvements in sleep apnoea, joint health, and quality of life</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div class="tip">For a person weighing 90 kg, even a 5% loss (4.5 kg) produces meaningful metabolic improvements. Set initial goals that are achievable &mdash; perfection is not required.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#127919;</span> Sustainable Weight Loss Strategies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on behaviour change, not just numbers:</strong> Build habits you can maintain for years, not just weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritise protein:</strong> Aim for 1.0&ndash;1.2 g/kg/day of protein. Protein preserves muscle during weight loss, increases satiety, and has the highest thermic effect of food.</li>
<li><strong>Eat more fibre:</strong> 25&ndash;30 g/day from vegetables, legumes, and whole grains increases fullness.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce liquid calories:</strong> Eliminate sugary drinks, fruit juices, and alcohol (or limit to minimal).</li>
<li><strong>Practise mindful eating:</strong> Eat slowly, without screens, paying attention to hunger and fullness cues.</li>
<li><strong>Get adequate sleep:</strong> 7&ndash;8 hours. Sleep deprivation increases ghrelin (hunger hormone) and decreases leptin (satiety hormone).</li>
<li><strong>Manage stress:</strong> Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which promotes visceral fat storage and insulin resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Track food intake:</strong> People who log food consistently lose 2&times; more weight than those who don&rsquo;t. Use apps like MyFitnessPal, HealthifyMe, or a simple diary.</li>
<li><strong>Regular physical activity:</strong> Both aerobic and resistance training. Exercise is especially critical for maintaining weight loss long-term.</li>
<li><strong>Structured programmes:</strong> The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention (aimed at 7% weight loss + 150 min exercise/week) reduced diabetes risk by 58%.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#9888;</span> Avoiding Crash Diets</h2>
<div class="warning">
<strong>Why crash diets are harmful in diabetes:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Muscle loss:</strong> Very low calorie diets (&lt;800 kcal/day) cause significant muscle loss, worsening insulin resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Hypoglycemia risk:</strong> Dramatic calorie restriction while on diabetes medications (especially insulin or sulfonylureas) can cause dangerous low blood sugar.</li>
<li><strong>Metabolic slowdown:</strong> Severe restriction lowers basal metabolic rate, making long-term maintenance harder.</li>
<li><strong>Nutrient deficiencies:</strong> Restricting food groups can lead to deficiencies in vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids.</li>
<li><strong>Rebound weight gain:</strong> 80&ndash;95% of people who lose weight rapidly regain it within 1&ndash;2 years, often with additional weight.</li>
<li><strong>Gallstones:</strong> Rapid weight loss (&gt;1.5 kg/week) increases gallstone risk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Approaches to be cautious about: juice cleanses, detox diets, single-food diets, extreme keto without medical supervision, any plan promising &gt;1 kg/week loss.</p>
<div class="note">Very Low Calorie Diets (VLCDs, 800 kcal/day) are sometimes used under strict medical supervision for short periods (8&ndash;12 weeks) to initiate rapid weight loss. This must only be done under a doctor&rsquo;s care with medication adjustments.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#127981;</span> Bariatric / Metabolic Surgery</h2>
<p>For people with severe obesity and poorly controlled diabetes, bariatric surgery is the most effective long-term treatment, often producing diabetes remission.</p>

<h3>Eligibility Criteria (Asian Indian thresholds)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>BMI &ge;37.5</strong> regardless of diabetes control.</li>
<li><strong>BMI 32.5&ndash;37.4</strong> with inadequately controlled Type 2 diabetes despite optimal medical therapy.</li>
<li><strong>BMI 27.5&ndash;32.4:</strong> May be considered on a case-by-case basis if diabetes is uncontrolled with optimal medical therapy (emerging evidence).</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">These thresholds are lower than Western guidelines (BMI &ge;40 or &ge;35 with comorbidities) because Asian Indians develop metabolic complications at lower BMI values.</div>

<h3>Common Procedures</h3>
<div class="table-wrap">
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Procedure</th><th>Expected Weight Loss</th><th>Diabetes Remission Rate</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB)</td><td>25&ndash;35% of total body weight</td><td>60&ndash;80%</td><td>Gold standard; both restrictive and malabsorptive</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sleeve Gastrectomy</td><td>20&ndash;30%</td><td>50&ndash;70%</td><td>Most commonly performed worldwide; simpler procedure</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mini Gastric Bypass (OAGB)</td><td>25&ndash;35%</td><td>60&ndash;75%</td><td>Single anastomosis; gaining popularity</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h3>Important Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Surgery is a tool, not a cure &mdash; lifelong dietary changes, exercise, and follow-up are essential.</li>
<li>Lifelong vitamin and mineral supplementation is required (B12, iron, calcium, vitamin D, folate).</li>
<li>Diabetes medications often need to be reduced or stopped immediately after surgery to prevent hypoglycemia.</li>
<li>Some patients experience diabetes recurrence after 5&ndash;10 years; long-term follow-up is crucial.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#128137;</span> GLP-1 Receptor Agonists for Weight Loss</h2>
<p>GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are injectable medications originally developed for diabetes that also produce significant weight loss by reducing appetite and slowing gastric emptying.</p>
<div class="table-wrap">
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Medication</th><th>Average Weight Loss</th><th>Diabetes Benefit</th><th>Administration</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Liraglutide (Saxenda/Victoza)</td><td>5&ndash;8% of body weight</td><td>Lowers HbA1c by 1&ndash;1.5%</td><td>Daily injection</td></tr>
<tr><td>Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy)</td><td>10&ndash;15%</td><td>Lowers HbA1c by 1.5&ndash;2%</td><td>Weekly injection</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound)</td><td>15&ndash;22%</td><td>Lowers HbA1c by 2&ndash;2.5%</td><td>Weekly injection</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<ul>
<li>These medications address both diabetes and obesity simultaneously &mdash; a major advantage.</li>
<li>Common side effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (usually improve over weeks).</li>
<li>Weight regain occurs if medication is stopped &mdash; long-term use may be needed.</li>
<li>Contraindicated in personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 syndrome.</li>
<li>Cost can be a barrier; availability varies by country.</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">GLP-1 RAs are increasingly seen as a bridge or complement to lifestyle changes. They can help break through weight loss plateaus and are now considered first-line for overweight/obese patients with Type 2 diabetes by many guidelines.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#128221;</span> Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even modest weight loss (5&ndash;10%) significantly improves diabetes control.</li>
<li>Use Asian Indian BMI and waist circumference cut-offs for accurate risk assessment.</li>
<li>Combine dietary changes with exercise for sustainable weight loss.</li>
<li>Avoid crash diets &mdash; they are dangerous in diabetes and unsustainable.</li>
<li>Bariatric surgery is an effective option for eligible patients with severe obesity.</li>
<li>GLP-1 receptor agonists offer pharmacological support for weight loss alongside glucose lowering.</li>
