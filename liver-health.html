<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F4D6;</span> NAFLD and NASH: Overview</h2>
<p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of liver conditions characterized by excess fat accumulation in the liver (steatosis) in the absence of significant alcohol consumption.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple steatosis (NAFL):</strong> Fat in the liver without significant inflammation or scarring. Generally benign, though it signals metabolic dysfunction.</li>
<li><strong>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH):</strong> Fat plus inflammation and hepatocyte injury (ballooning). NASH can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.</li>
<li><strong>Fibrosis:</strong> Scarring of the liver tissue. Staged F0 (none) through F4 (cirrhosis).</li>
<li><strong>Cirrhosis:</strong> Irreversible scarring that impairs liver function. End-stage liver disease may require transplantation.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">The terminology is evolving. Recent consensus has renamed NAFLD to MASLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) and NASH to MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis) to better reflect the metabolic etiology. You may encounter either term.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F4CA;</span> Prevalence in Diabetes</h2>
<ul>
<li>NAFLD is present in an estimated 55-70% of people with Type 2 diabetes.</li>
<li>NASH is present in approximately 30-40% of those with NAFLD (i.e., ~20-30% of all people with Type 2 diabetes).</li>
<li>Significant fibrosis (F2+) is found in 15-20% of people with Type 2 diabetes.</li>
<li>Type 2 diabetes is an independent risk factor for progression from NAFLD to NASH, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver-related mortality.</li>
<li>NAFLD/NASH is now the fastest-growing indication for liver transplantation.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F504;</span> The Bidirectional Relationship</h2>
<p>Diabetes and fatty liver disease fuel each other in a vicious cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insulin resistance</strong> is the central driver of both conditions. The liver becomes resistant to insulin's ability to suppress glucose production and promote fat storage regulation.</li>
<li><strong>Hepatic fat accumulation</strong> worsens insulin resistance, increases hepatic glucose output, and raises fasting blood glucose.</li>
<li><strong>NAFLD increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes</strong> by 2-5 fold, independent of obesity.</li>
<li><strong>Diabetes accelerates liver disease progression:</strong> People with diabetes and NAFLD progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis faster than those without diabetes.</li>
<li><strong>Shared risk factors:</strong> Obesity (especially visceral/central), dyslipidemia, hypertension, and sedentary lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F50D;</span> Screening and Diagnosis</h2>
<p>NAFLD is often asymptomatic until advanced stages. Screening is recommended for all people with Type 2 diabetes.</p>

<h3>Initial Assessment</h3>
<div class="table-wrap">
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Test</th><th>What It Shows</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>ALT / AST (liver enzymes)</td><td>Hepatocyte injury</td><td>May be normal even in significant NASH/fibrosis. Normal ALT does not rule out NAFLD.</td></tr>
<tr><td>GGT</td><td>Liver/biliary injury</td><td>Often elevated in NAFLD; helps assess overall liver health.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Abdominal ultrasound</td><td>Detects hepatic steatosis</td><td>Widely available, inexpensive; cannot distinguish NASH from simple steatosis; insensitive if &lt;30% fat.</td></tr>
<tr><td>FIB-4 index</td><td>Non-invasive fibrosis score (age, AST, ALT, platelet count)</td><td>Good screening tool: low score (&lt;1.3) reliably excludes advanced fibrosis. High score (&gt;2.67) suggests advanced fibrosis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS)</td><td>Non-invasive fibrosis score</td><td>Uses age, BMI, diabetes status, AST/ALT ratio, platelet count, albumin.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h3>Advanced Assessment (if FIB-4 is indeterminate or high)</h3>
<div class="table-wrap">
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Test</th><th>What It Shows</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>FibroScan (transient elastography)</td><td>Liver stiffness (correlates with fibrosis) and CAP score (steatosis)</td><td>Non-invasive, quick, increasingly available. Key tool for staging fibrosis without biopsy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MRI-PDFF</td><td>Precise liver fat quantification</td><td>Most accurate non-invasive measure of steatosis. Used mainly in research/trials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MR elastography</td><td>Liver stiffness</td><td>Most accurate non-invasive measure of fibrosis. Limited availability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Liver biopsy</td><td>Definitive diagnosis — steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, fibrosis</td><td>Gold standard but invasive. Reserved for diagnostic uncertainty or clinical trials.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<div class="tip">The ADA recommends that all people with Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes with obesity be assessed for NAFLD. Start with liver enzymes and a FIB-4 score. If FIB-4 is elevated or indeterminate, proceed to FibroScan or hepatology referral.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F48A;</span> Management</h2>

<h3>Weight Loss — The Cornerstone</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>3-5% weight loss:</strong> Reduces hepatic steatosis.</li>
<li><strong>7-10% weight loss:</strong> Can resolve NASH (inflammation and ballooning) in many patients.</li>
<li><strong>&gt;10% weight loss:</strong> Can improve and even reverse fibrosis.</li>
<li>Achieved through caloric restriction (500-1000 kcal/day deficit), preferably with a Mediterranean dietary pattern (rich in olive oil, fish, nuts, vegetables; low in processed foods, added sugars, and refined carbohydrates).</li>
<li>Avoid fructose-heavy beverages (sodas, fruit juices) — fructose is directly lipogenic in the liver.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ul>
<li>At least 150-200 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.</li>
<li>Resistance training 2-3 times/week.</li>
<li>Exercise reduces liver fat independent of weight loss by improving insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function.</li>
<li>Avoid prolonged sedentary behavior — break up sitting time every 30-60 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pharmacological Approaches</h3>
<p>No drug is currently FDA-approved specifically for NAFLD/NASH treatment, but several agents used in diabetes management show liver benefits:</p>
<div class="table-wrap">
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Agent</th><th>Evidence</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Pioglitazone</td><td>Improves NASH histology (inflammation, ballooning, steatosis) in multiple trials. May improve fibrosis.</td><td>Can be used in patients without diabetes too. Side effects: weight gain, fluid retention, fracture risk. Avoid in heart failure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vitamin E (800 IU/day)</td><td>Improves NASH in non-diabetic patients (PIVENS trial). Modest benefit in diabetes.</td><td>Long-term safety concerns at high doses (possible increased all-cause mortality, prostate cancer risk). Use with caution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, liraglutide)</td><td>Semaglutide showed NASH resolution in ~60% of patients in phase 2 trials. Weight loss and direct hepatic effects.</td><td>Semaglutide is being studied specifically for NASH (phase 3). Already used for diabetes and obesity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SGLT2 inhibitors</td><td>Reduce liver fat, ALT levels, and liver stiffness in several studies.</td><td>Benefits likely mediated through weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced inflammation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Resmetirom</td><td>First drug specifically approved for NASH with moderate-to-advanced fibrosis (FDA approved 2024).</td><td>Thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist. Reduces liver fat, resolves NASH, and improves fibrosis.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<div class="note">Metformin, while a cornerstone of Type 2 diabetes treatment, does not significantly improve liver histology in NASH and should not be used specifically for that purpose. However, it remains appropriate for glycemic control.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1F377;</span> Alcohol Limits</h2>
<ul>
<li>People with NAFLD should limit alcohol to minimize additional liver injury.</li>
<li><strong>General guidance:</strong> No more than 1&ndash;2 standard drinks/day depending on body size (and many hepatologists recommend less or none if NASH or fibrosis is present).</li>
<li>One standard drink = 14 g of pure alcohol (approximately 350 mL beer, 150 mL wine, or 45 mL spirits).</li>
<li><strong>With significant fibrosis or cirrhosis:</strong> Complete abstinence is strongly recommended.</li>
<li>Alcohol also worsens blood glucose control, adds empty calories, and increases hypoglycemia risk in those on insulin or sulfonylureas.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x26A0;</span> Medications to Use with Caution in Liver Disease</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metformin:</strong> Safe in NAFLD and mild-moderate liver disease. Contraindicated only in decompensated cirrhosis (risk of lactic acidosis with severely impaired hepatic lactate clearance).</li>
<li><strong>Statins:</strong> Safe and recommended in NAFLD/NASH (cardiovascular benefit is paramount). Avoid only in decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure. Mild ALT elevation on statins is common and usually not a reason to stop.</li>
<li><strong>Sulfonylureas:</strong> Metabolized by the liver; use with caution in advanced liver disease (unpredictable effect, hypoglycemia risk).</li>
<li><strong>Thiazolidinediones:</strong> Pioglitazone is beneficial for NASH but avoid in decompensated liver disease. Never use in active liver disease with ALT &gt;2.5x upper limit of normal (package insert guidance).</li>
<li><strong>Acetaminophen (paracetamol):</strong> Limit to &lt;2 g/day in liver disease (standard max is 4 g/day). Avoid with concurrent alcohol use.</li>
<li><strong>NSAIDs:</strong> Avoid in cirrhosis — risk of renal failure, GI bleeding, and fluid retention.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>People with diabetes and NASH are at elevated risk for progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):</p>
<ul>
<li>Annual FibroScan or FIB-4 to monitor fibrosis progression.</li>
<li>If cirrhosis is established: ultrasound every 6 months for HCC surveillance (with or without alpha-fetoprotein).</li>
<li>Upper endoscopy to screen for esophageal varices.</li>
<li>Monitor for signs of decompensation: ascites (abdominal swelling), jaundice, confusion (hepatic encephalopathy), variceal bleeding.</li>
<li>Liver transplant evaluation for those with decompensated cirrhosis or HCC meeting criteria.</li>
</ul>
<div class="warning">Liver disease in diabetes is often "silent" — normal liver enzymes do not rule out significant fibrosis. Proactive screening with FIB-4 and FibroScan can catch advanced disease before it becomes irreversible.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#x1FA7A;</span> When to See a Hepatologist / Gastroenterologist</h2>
<ul>
<li>FIB-4 score &gt;2.67 or indeterminate (1.3-2.67) with abnormal FibroScan.</li>
