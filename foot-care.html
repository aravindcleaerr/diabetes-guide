<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#129462;</span> Why Foot Care Matters</h2>
<p>Peripheral neuropathy (loss of sensation), peripheral arterial disease (reduced blood flow), and impaired immune function create a "perfect storm" in the diabetic foot. Minor injuries that would heal quickly in a healthy person can become non-healing ulcers, deep infections, and ultimately lead to amputation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diabetes accounts for more than 50% of all non-traumatic lower-limb amputations.</li>
<li>A foot ulcer precedes 85% of diabetes-related amputations.</li>
<li>5-year mortality after a diabetes-related amputation exceeds 50% — worse than many cancers.</li>
<li>Up to 85% of amputations are potentially preventable with proper foot care and early intervention.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#128270;</span> Daily Foot Inspection Routine</h2>
<p>Make foot inspection a daily habit, ideally at the same time each day (e.g., before bed or after bathing).</p>
<ul class="checklist" onclick="if(event.target.tagName==='LI')event.target.classList.toggle('checked')">
<li>Look at the tops, bottoms, sides, and between all toes of both feet</li>
<li>Use a mirror or ask a family member to help inspect the soles</li>
<li>Check for cuts, blisters, cracks, redness, swelling, or warmth</li>
<li>Check for calluses, corns, bruises, color changes, drainage, or odor</li>
<li>Feel for temperature differences between the two feet</li>
<li>Check that toenails are intact and not ingrown</li>
<li>Wash feet with lukewarm water and mild soap</li>
<li>Dry thoroughly, especially between toes</li>
<li>Apply moisturizer (not between toes)</li>
<li>Inspect shoes before wearing &mdash; shake out and feel inside</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">Make it part of your routine — keep a small mirror by your bed or chair. Even if your feet feel fine, look at them every day. Neuropathy means you cannot rely on pain to alert you to problems.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#128167;</span> Washing and Moisturizing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wash feet daily with lukewarm water and mild soap. Test water temperature with your elbow or a thermometer — never your feet (you may not feel if it is too hot).</li>
<li>Do not soak feet for prolonged periods — this softens the skin excessively and increases infection risk.</li>
<li>Dry feet thoroughly, especially between the toes (moisture promotes fungal infections).</li>
<li>Apply a fragrance-free moisturizing lotion or cream to the tops and bottoms of feet to prevent drying and cracking.</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> apply moisturizer between the toes (traps moisture, promotes fungal growth).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#9986;</span> Proper Nail Care</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cut toenails straight across — do not round the corners (prevents ingrown toenails).</li>
<li>File edges gently with an emery board to smooth sharp corners.</li>
<li>Do not cut nails too short — leave a small margin of white.</li>
<li>Cut nails after bathing when they are softer.</li>
<li>If you have thick nails, poor vision, neuropathy, or poor circulation, have a podiatrist cut your nails.</li>
<li>Never use sharp instruments (razor blades, scissors) to remove calluses or corns.</li>
<li>Do not use chemical corn/callus removers — they can burn diabetic skin.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#128094;</span> Footwear Selection</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wide toe box:</strong> Shoes should have ample room for toes without crowding or friction.</li>
<li><strong>Proper fit:</strong> Shop for shoes in the afternoon (feet swell during the day). Have both feet measured — sizes may differ.</li>
<li><strong>Break in new shoes gradually:</strong> Wear for 1-2 hours at a time initially and check feet for red spots or blisters.</li>
<li><strong>Closed-toe shoes:</strong> Protect feet from injury. Avoid sandals, flip-flops, and pointed shoes.</li>
<li><strong>No bare feet — ever:</strong> Not at home, not at the beach, not at the pool. Always wear shoes or slippers.</li>
<li><strong>Inspect shoes before wearing:</strong> Shake out shoes and feel inside for pebbles, rough seams, or foreign objects.</li>
<li><strong>Custom orthotic insoles:</strong> Prescribed therapeutic footwear and custom insoles reduce ulcer recurrence by 25-50%. Covered by insurance in many countries for high-risk patients.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid high heels</strong> and shoes with thin soles (inadequate cushioning and pressure redistribution).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Diabetic Socks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Seamless construction to prevent friction and pressure points.</li>
<li>Moisture-wicking materials (avoid 100% cotton).</li>
<li>Non-constricting tops (no tight elastic bands that impair circulation).</li>
<li>Light padding on the sole for cushioning.</li>
<li>Change socks daily; avoid wearing damp socks.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#9888;</span> Charcot Foot (Charcot Neuroarthropathy)</h2>
<p>A serious complication where neuropathy leads to progressive weakening, fracture, and dislocation of bones and joints in the foot, often without significant pain. If untreated, the foot collapses into a "rocker bottom" deformity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early signs:</strong> Unilateral swelling, redness, and warmth in the foot (often mistaken for infection or gout).</li>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Clinical suspicion is key. X-rays may initially be normal; MRI is more sensitive. Compare skin temperature between both feet (difference of &gt;2°C is significant).</li>
<li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Immediate offloading (total contact cast or removable walker) for 3-6 months until the acute phase resolves. Weight-bearing on an active Charcot foot causes progressive destruction.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term:</strong> Custom molded shoes and orthotics. Surgery may be needed for unstable deformities.</li>
</ul>
<div class="warning">A red, hot, swollen foot in a person with diabetic neuropathy is Charcot foot until proven otherwise. This is an emergency — continued walking on an active Charcot foot can destroy the foot's architecture in weeks.</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#129729;</span> Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)</h2>
<p>Reduced blood flow to the feet from atherosclerosis of the leg arteries. PAD combined with neuropathy dramatically increases amputation risk.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Claudication (calf pain with walking that resolves with rest), rest pain (severe — suggests critical limb ischemia), cold feet, slow-healing wounds, absent pulses.</li>
<li><strong>Screening:</strong> Palpate dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses at every visit. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) if symptoms or absent pulses (normal 1.0-1.3; &lt;0.9 indicates PAD).</li>
<li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Smoking cessation (critical), antiplatelet therapy, statins, supervised exercise programs, revascularization (angioplasty/stent or bypass surgery) for critical limb ischemia.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#129658;</span> When to See a Podiatrist</h2>
<ul>
<li>At least annually for comprehensive foot risk assessment (more frequently if high risk).</li>
<li>For routine nail care if you have neuropathy, PAD, poor vision, or limited mobility.</li>
<li>Immediately for any wound, ulcer, infection, or color change.</li>
<li>For callus debridement — never remove calluses yourself.</li>
<li>For footwear evaluation and custom orthotic prescription.</li>
<li>After any previous ulcer or amputation — you are at very high risk for recurrence.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2><span class="icon-sm">&#129657;</span> Wound Care Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clean the wound gently with saline or clean water. Avoid hydrogen peroxide or iodine (they damage healing tissue).</li>
<li>Apply a sterile dressing and keep the wound moist (moist wound healing is faster than dry).</li>
<li><strong>Offloading is critical:</strong> Take pressure off the affected area. Do not walk on a foot ulcer — use crutches, a wheelchair, or a prescribed offloading device (total contact cast, removable cast walker).</li>
<li>Monitor for signs of infection: increasing redness, swelling, warmth, pain, drainage, fever, or worsening blood glucose.</li>
<li>Seek medical attention for any wound that does not show improvement within 1-2 weeks despite proper care.</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">Diabetic foot ulcers require a multidisciplinary approach: endocrinologist (glucose control), podiatrist (wound care, offloading), vascular surgeon (blood flow assessment), infectious disease specialist (if infected), and orthotist (therapeutic footwear).</div>
